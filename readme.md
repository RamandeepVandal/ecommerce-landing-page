# E-commerce Landing Page Project
This is a front-end project that features an e-commerce landing page and product page. The project is built using React and Bootstrap.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. You will need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. In your root directory, run **npm i** to install all dependencies and then run **npm run dev** to run the application. 

## Improvements/Changes
I'm working towards creating a functional cart system, checkout system, increasing the product catalog, and implementing login/registration authentication.
